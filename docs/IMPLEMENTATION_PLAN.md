## ðŸ”„ Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
1. **Incremental Development**: Each segment builds upon the previous
2. **Test-Driven**: Test each segment before moving to the next
3. **User-Centric**: Focus on user experience and flow
4. **Performance-First**: Optimize for speed and responsiveness

### Key Considerations
- **Single Session**: No authentication required, all data is session-based
- **Single Template**: Fixed template matching Figma design
- **Real-time Updates**: Text updates on blur, photo updates on crop save
- **Image Constraints**: Square aspect ratio, minimum 300x300 pixels
- **Platform Support**: 9 social media platforms with validation

### Testing Protocol
After each segment:
1. **Functionality Test**: Verify all features work as expected
2. **Integration Test**: Ensure components work together
3. **User Flow Test**: Complete end-to-end user journey
4. **Performance Test**: Check loading times and responsiveness
5. **Bug Fix**: Address any issues before proceeding

This implementation plan provides a clear, manageable path to building the Badge Maker application with logical segments that can be implemented and tested incrementally.
