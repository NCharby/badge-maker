## 🚨 Critical Missing Features

### High Priority
1. **React Advanced Cropper Integration** - Core functionality for image editing
2. **Badge Template Styling** - Preview doesn't match Figma design specifications
3. **API Routes Implementation** - No backend integration for saving badges
4. **Image Storage Integration** - No Supabase storage implementation

### Medium Priority
1. **Platform-specific Social Media Display** - Social handles not shown in preview
2. **Complete Confirmation Flow** - Missing badge data display
3. **Session Management** - No session creation or management

### Low Priority
1. **Performance Optimization** - Not yet needed
2. **Comprehensive Testing** - Can be done after core features
3. **Accessibility Improvements** - Can be done in final polish

├── badges/                # Badge CRUD operations
│   ├── route.ts           # POST (create badge)
│   └── [id]/route.ts      # GET (retrieve badge)

    └── route.ts           # GET (get template config)
```

## 🔧 **Updated Setup Instructions:**

Now you only need to create **one private storage bucket** in your Supabase dashboard:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → Storage
2. **Create one bucket**:
   - **Name**: `badge-images`
   - **Public bucket**: ❌ Unchecked (private for security)
   - **File size limit**: 5MB
   - **Allowed MIME types**: `image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif`

The folders (`original/` and `cropped/`) will be created automatically when files are uploaded.

## 🔒 **Security Benefits:**

1. **Private Access**: Images are not publicly accessible
2. **Signed URLs**: Temporary, secure access with expiration
3. **Access Control**: Only authenticated users can upload
4. **No Hotlinking**: Images cannot be accessed without proper authorization
5. **Expiration**: URLs automatically expire after 1 hour
