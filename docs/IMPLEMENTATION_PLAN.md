- **Single Template**: Fixed template matching the Figma design specifications
- **Real-time Updates**: Text updates on blur, photo updates on crop save
- **Image Constraints**: Square aspect ratio, minimum 300x300 pixels
- **Platform Support**: 9 social media platforms with validation

### Testing Protocol
After each segment:
1. **Functionality Test**: Verify all features work as expected
2. **Integration Test**: Ensure components work together
3. **User Flow Test**: Complete end-to-end user journey
4. **Performance Test**: Check loading times and responsiveness
5. **Bug Fix**: Address any issues before proceeding
