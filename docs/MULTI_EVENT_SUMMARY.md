## Technical Architecture

### Database Changes
```sql
-- New Tables
events                    -- Event information and metadata

-- Modified Tables
sessions                 -- Added event_id column
waivers                  -- Added event_id column + firstName/lastName columns
badges                   -- Added event_id column
```

### Routing Structure
```
src/app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [eventName]/          # Dynamic event routes
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ landing/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ waiver/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ badge/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ confirmation/
```

### State Management
```typescript
interface UserFlowState {
  // Updated name fields
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  
  // Other existing fields...
  eventSlug: string;
  eventData: EventData | null;
  eventPhotos: Record<string, string>;
  eventBadgeData: Record<string, BadgeData>;
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Database Foundation** (2-3 days)
- Create new database tables
- Add event_id columns to existing tables
- **Updated**: Add firstName and lastName columns to waivers table
- **Updated**: Migrate existing fullName data to separate fields
- Set up default event and data migration
- Test database changes

### **Phase 2: Routing and Context** (2-3 days)
- Implement dynamic routing with `[event-name]` parameter
- Create event context provider and hook
- Add event validation middleware
- Test routing functionality

### **Phase 3: Event Management** (2-3 days)
- Create event header component
- Update state management for events
- Implement event-specific storage paths
- **Updated**: Update PDF naming functions to use firstName/lastName
- Test event management features

### **Phase 4: Component Updates** (4-5 days)
- **Updated**: Split name input fields in LandingForm
- Update existing components to use event context
- Modify API routes for event support
- Implement event-specific functionality
- **Updated**: Update PDF generation to use separate name fields
- Test component integration

### **Phase 5: Testing and Migration** (2-3 days)

- Migration testing
- Documentation updates

## Implementation Changes

### ‚úÖ **What Continues to Work**
- All existing data (user profiles, photos, badge data)
- All existing templates and API endpoints
- Core functionality (badge creation, waiver signing)

### üîÑ **What Changes**
- URL structure (all routes now require event context)
- Database schema (new tables and columns)
- Storage organization (event-based folders)
- Component display (event information shown)
- Routing (no legacy route support)
- **Updated**: Name fields (split from fullName to firstName/lastName)

### üõ°Ô∏è **Migration Strategy**
- **Clean Break**: Old URLs no longer work, redirect to 404
- **Data Preservation**: All existing data linked to default event
- **Root Redirect**: `/` redirects to `/default/landing`
- **Event Required**: All routes must include valid event slug
- **Name Field Migration**: Parse existing `fullName` into `firstName` and `lastName`

### Name Field Migration Details
```sql
-- Add new columns
ALTER TABLE public.waivers 
ADD COLUMN first_name TEXT,
ADD COLUMN last_name TEXT;

-- Migrate existing data
UPDATE public.waivers 
SET 
  first_name = SPLIT_PART(full_name, ' ', 1),
  last_name = CASE 
    WHEN POSITION(' ' IN full_name) > 0 
    THEN SUBSTRING(full_name FROM POSITION(' ' IN full_name) + 1)
    ELSE ''
  END
WHERE full_name IS NOT NULL;

-- Make fields required
ALTER TABLE public.waivers 
ALTER COLUMN first_name SET NOT NULL,
ALTER COLUMN last_name SET NOT NULL;
```

The phased implementation approach delivers a modern, event-focused system without the complexity of maintaining legacy routes. The clean break from old URL patterns allows for a more maintainable and scalable architecture.

The addition of separate first/last name fields makes the system more robust and professional, eliminating parsing errors in PDF naming and providing better data structure for future enhancements.

The system is designed to grow with your needs, supporting everything from small single events to large multi-event organizations, all while maintaining the simplicity and reliability that makes the current Badge Maker system successful.
